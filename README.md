# React + express API

This project is just a trial on how to use react(front end) and node js express API as a backend API service. It's kinda like a boilerplate.

## Installation

Use the NPM package manager to install the backend API from the parent folder.

```bash
npm install
```

Then cd to client-side to install react dependencies by NPM

```bash
npm install
```
